\chapter{Input/Output}

\begin{intro}
  The \emph{MantaMate} features four 16-bit DACs and eight 12-bit DACs. As such, if
  you are using a \emph{Manta} host, the IO varies depending on the
  \texttt{Mode} the \emph{Manta} is in. Throughout this chapter, the nine \nicefrac{1}{8}
  inch outputs
  of the \emph{MantaMate} will be referenced naturally as \texttt{OUT 1} through
  \texttt{OUT 12}:

  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | m{1.5cm} | m{1.5cm}| m{1.5cm} | }
    \hline
    \texttt{OUT 1} & \texttt{OUT 2} & \texttt{OUT 3} \\
    \hline
    \texttt{OUT 4} & \texttt{OUT 5} & \texttt{OUT 6} \\
    \hline
    \texttt{OUT 7} & \texttt{OUT 8} & \texttt{OUT 9} \\
    \hline
    \texttt{OUT 10} & \texttt{OUT 11} & \texttt{OUT 12} \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

  Note that the rightmost DAC outputs are 16-bit and the remainder are 12-bit,
  therefore more precise outputs (such as 1V/O) will be output from  \texttt{OUT 3},
   \texttt{OUT 6},  \texttt{OUT 9}, and \texttt{OUT 12}.

  The one \nicefrac{1}{8} inch input will always be a \texttt{CLOCK IN}, although
  some devices will not make use of a clock.
\end{intro}

\section{Non-Manta Host Devices}
  Using a non-Manta device is generally straightforward. In most cases,
  USB-MIDI devices and HID devices will work in a 'plug-and-play' fashion.

  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | m{1.5cm} | m{1.5cm}| m{1.5cm} | }
    \hline
    \texttt{???} & \texttt{???} & \texttt{???} \\
    \hline
    \texttt{???} & \texttt{???} & \texttt{???} \\
    \hline
    \texttt{???} & \texttt{???} & \texttt{???} \\
    \hline
    \texttt{???} & \texttt{???} & \texttt{???} \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
