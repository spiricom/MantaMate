\chapter{Other Input Devices}

\begin{intro}
  This section covers using other HOST devices with the \emph{MantaMate}. We hope
  that  any input device you can think of works with the \emph{MantaMate}, but we
  cannot make any guarantees. Below outlines some of the devices we tested and ensured
  worked as one would expect!
\end{intro}

\section{Computer/DAW}
  This works right? I think Jeff mentioned it worked? It'd be killer if it did.

\section{USB-MIDI Keyboard Controller}
  This definitely works but I don't know to what extent (are we guessing knobs
  MIDI channels and then converting that to CV???? If we are, we are awesome)

\section{USB Game Controller}
  Gotta test this again too

\section{Guitar Hero Controller}
  This would be silly but fun

\section{DDR Dance Pad}
  Maybe only vaguely usable but who else can say they have DDR working on Eurorack!?
